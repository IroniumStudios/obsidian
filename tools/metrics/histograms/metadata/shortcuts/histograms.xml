  <summary>
    This is a record of the number of files in the directory used to store icons
    for the web &quot;shortcut&quot; feature. This is recorded when the user
    creates a shortcut using the 3-dot-menu -&gt; &quot;Save and Share&quot;
    -&gt; &quot;Create Shortcut&quot; functionality. If this metric shows that
    users have a large number of files here, then a new design or some other
    mitigation may be required. This requires the kShortcutsNotApps feature to
    be enabled.
